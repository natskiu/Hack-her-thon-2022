## Who are we?
Hi! We are a team of six female undergraduate students from Imperial College London. We are presenting what we have achieved in a 24-hour hack-her-thon (good pun eh?). 

## Our Journey
Global warming is a pressing issue. Our solution is to make an interactive website to help people make better choices about the food they consume. This might help reduce the carbon footprint. We obtained a comprehensive and reliable dataset from a scientific paper published in Nature (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-00909-8#Sec2). From there, we extracted some insights and summarised them graphically to present on our website. Though some might say our conclusions are just 'common knowledge', we feel that it is still great to validate the common beliefs with data, and showcase what we have learnt in 24 hours!

## What we have achieved
### Website
If you are interested in seeing the website ```git clone``` the entire repository and ```run index.html``` in your browser. 

### Data Visualisation
The data visualisation was done on Jupyter notebooks. Go check out ```eda.ipynb``` and ```data vis food update.ipynb``` and see if you agree with us!
